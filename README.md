It provides simple instructions to set up the project locally by cloning the repo and opening or running it, and to deploy it via GitHub Pages by pushing to the main branch. It outlines the folder structure (assets, CSS, JS, HTML) and includes your contact info (email, LinkedIn, GitHub). The project is licensed under the MIT License. Customize names, links, and details to fit your profile.
